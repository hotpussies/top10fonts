Top 10 LaTeX Fonts
==================

Instead of working on my thesis, I created this project to showcase the beauty and history of the most popular LaTeX fonts. Every font is described by a paragraph that is also set in that font, made possible by the dvipng utility that creates PNG images from DVI originals.

Creating the images
-------------------

All PNG images are also checked into this repository, so to view the final product simply open index.html in a browser. If you make a change to any .tex file, run `make` to automatically update the necessary PNG images.
